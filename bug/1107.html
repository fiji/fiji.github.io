<pre class="bz_comment_text" >I'm using Fiji version 21041125 and ijpb/MorphoLibJ release v1.0.7.

I've tried several different commands from the fabulous ijpb/MorphoLibJ plugin library when running Fiji using --headless and --jython.  I have many Jython scripts that call other Fiji plugin commands successfully.  My scripts that attempt to use commands generally follow this pattern:

# Open the input image file.
input_image_plus = IJ.openImage( input )

# Create a copy of the image.
input_image_plus_copy = input_image_plus.createImagePlus()
image_processor_copy = input_image_plus.getProcessor().duplicate()
input_image_plus_copy.setProcessor( &quot;iCopy&quot;, image_processor_copy )

# Run the command.
IJ.run( input_image_plus_copy, &quot;Fill Holes (Binary/Gray)&quot;, &quot;&quot; )

# Save the ImagePlus object as a new image.
IJ.saveAs( input_image_plus_copy, output_datatype, output_path )

The script finishes successfully, but no analysis is performed on the image (i.e., it remains basically the same as the original input).  Also, when running from the command line (instead of a Browser), the Fiji log ends with a &quot;Java Null pointer exception&quot;.

I'm wondering if I'm missing something, or if there is something that needs to be added to the ijpb/MorphoLibJ plugin that enables it to be run in headless mode via Python script calls.  I'm not a Java expert, so any help will be much appreciated.

Thanks!</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >After working with additional plugins from the command line (e.g., <a href="http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:filter:edge_detection:start">http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:filter:edge_detection:start</a>, <a href="http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:morphology:skeletonize3d:start">http://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/doku.php?id=plugin:morphology:skeletonize3d:start</a> ), it seems that plugins may be producing output images in various ways, and that may be causing the behavior I'm seeing.

For example, the skeletonize3d plugin allows me to save the analyzed image using the following commands from a Python script:

input_image_plus = IJ.openImage( input )
# Create a copy of the image.
input_image_plus_copy = input_image_plus.createImagePlus()
image_processor_copy = input_image_plus.getProcessor().duplicate()
input_image_plus_copy.setProcessor( &quot;iCopy&quot;, image_processor_copy )
# Run the command.
IJ.run( input_image_plus_copy, &quot;Skeletonize (2D/3D)&quot;, &quot;&quot; )
# Save the ImagePlus object as a new image.
IJ.saveAs( input_image_plus_copy, output_datatype, tmp_output_path )

In some way, the plugin &quot;overlays&quot; the original input_image_plus_copy object with the new analyzed image, so when I save it, I have what I expect.

However, using similar commands with the edge_detection plugin does not behave the same way.  It must be producing a separate image (to which I do not know how to get a handle from the command line), so the original input_image_plus_copy object is saved rather than the analyzed image.  The behavior of this plugin is similar to the behavior of the ijpb/MorphoLibJ plugin.

So is it possible to get a handle on output images for those plugins that do not &quot;overlay&quot; the original image when run from the command line?

I've looked everywhere in (the Fiji tutorials and docs, OpenStack, etc), but have not found any information about this.

Thanks very much for any insight on this.</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Thanks for the report, Greg.

Firstly, please note that there is a serious bug preventing Jython scripts from working headlessly on Windows:

<a href="https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/114">https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/114</a>

If you are using Windows, as a workaround, you can use any other scripting language besides Jython. Obviously we hope to fix this in the future, but cannot promise a timeline right now.

Anyway, I'm guessing you are on a different OS, since you say the script finishes successfully...

Secondly, note that ImageJ2's headless mode is an extension of ImageJ1 to work headless in only certain cases. Some plugins will simply not work headless, due to hardcoded usage of headless-unfriendly GUI elements. The typical symptom there is java.awt.HeadlessException being thrown, which from your description I assume you are not seeing either?

Off the top of my head, I do not have an easy answer for you for grabbing handles to existing images while headless. (The WindowManager won't work because it is unfortunately a UI element which needs to be overridden.)

Regarding the NullPointerException, that sounds like a likely culprit and it would be helpful if you could paste the full stack trace of that message.

Looking at the Edge Detection plugin source code, I see several serious potential issues with using them headless:

* The Conn_Tres is a PlugInFrame, which is a UI element.
* There are multiple calls to WindowManager.getCurrentImage(), which (IIRC) may not work correctly headless.

In short, the headless mode is fraught with difficulty, especially when third party plugins are involved. Your best bet is probably to install xvfb on your headless machine and run your scripts that way, so that your scripts behave better.

Or, if you are running these scripts on your local machine (i.e., not a headless server or cluster somewhere), then why use --headless at all? Just don't pass that flag.

I am marking this as NEEDSINFO in case you want to provide more detail on the NullPointerException, or if you can isolate more specifics about how things go wrong, what you expect to happen instead, etc. If xvfb and/or not using --headless works for you instead though, then I would favor closing this issue as &quot;WONTFIX&quot; since we don't have the resources this year to improve ImageJ's legacy headless mode.</pre>

Hello Curtis,

Thanks very much for you response to my questions.  Please see my inline comments.

<span class="quote">&gt; Thanks for the report, Greg.
&gt; 
&gt; Firstly, please note that there is a serious bug preventing Jython scripts
&gt; from working headlessly on Windows:
&gt; 
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/114">https://github.com/imagej/imagej/issues/114</a></span >

This is no problem for me.  I am developing on and for only Mac OS X and Linux x86_64.

<span class="quote">&gt;

I will paste the full stack trace of 3 plugins that behave in this way in separate comments.

I will try this approach next to see if I an make the problematic plugins work from the command line.  Thanks for this pointer - I did see some comments on this in my searches, but have not yet implemented my tools to use it.

I am wrapping ImageJ2 tools in Galaxy (<a href="https://galaxyproject.org">https://galaxyproject.org</a>), and in order to do this, I need to run the tools from the command line.  I've wrapped several tools so far using various Fiji plugins and am planning to wrap as many more as possible.  These tools are available at <a href="https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools/tree/master/tools/image_processing/imagej2">https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools/tree/master/tools/image_processing/imagej2</a>

That error was fixed awhile back. So it suggest to me that you are:

A) Using Java 8; and
B) Not using the most up-to-date version of Fiji.

Is that accurate? If so, please try again with a fully up-to-date Fiji installation.</pre>

Hello Curtis,

I am using the latest &quot;stable&quot; version of Fiji (Fiji Life-Line version, 2014 November 25) downloaded from <a href="http://fiji.sc/downloads/Life-Line/fiji-macosx-20141125.dmg">http://fiji.sc/downloads/Life-Line/fiji-macosx-20141125.dmg</a>.  I am also using Java 8 - my &quot;About ImageJ states:

ImageJ 1.49
Java 1.8.0_20

Obviously this is a fairly old version of Fiji, but I'd like to stay on a specific version if I can because the tools I'm building require reproducible behavior, so always just downloading the latest development build is not possible (I can do so for development purposes however).  

Do you have an estimate as to the date of the next stable release of Fiji?

I'll try the latest development build to see if it makes a difference with these plugins.

Thanks for you help!

Greg</pre>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" >Thanks Greg. To be clear, the continuous release of Fiji is not a &quot;development build&quot; -- each update is a reproducible version (i.e., all release versions of JAR files) built from Fiji's master branch.

The ImageJ2 development build is _not_ reproducible, but I think the Downloads page is pretty clear about that.

The main problem with the Fiji continuous releases is that they are not currently archived anywhere and you can't downgrade. So to actually roll back you'd need to know which commit hash you were on and rebuild Fiji using Maven. Someday we hope to have a rollback feature, but it's probably not going to happen this year.

As for when we do another Life-Line version: we try to do one just before making disruptive changes. The next disruptive change will certainly be the switch over to Java 8 with a new deployment scheme that retires the ImageJ Launcher. We hope to roll that out before September.</pre>

Actually, it is also &quot;reproducible&quot; in the sense that the build can be recreated at a later date:

<a href="http://imagej.net/Reproducible_builds">http://imagej.net/Reproducible_builds</a>

But unlike the Fiji master branch, the ImageJ2 master branch is not a release version.</pre>

Thanks for the clarification on this, but when building tools for Galaxy, we build them in such a way that all dependencies come with the tool when it is installed from the Galaxy tool shed (<a href="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu">https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu</a>) into a Galaxy instance.  The Galaxy wrappers for the Imagej2 tools I'm building define a dependency on the Fiji package using an installation recipe within an xml file.  This xml file has a tag set that looks l-soemthing like this:

<a href="http://fiji.sc/downloads/Life-Line/fiji-linux64-20141125.tar.gz">http://fiji.sc/downloads/Life-Line/fiji-linux64-20141125.tar.gz</a>

This URL always guarantees that specific build of Fiji, so if the Galaxy administrator uninstalls a tool and its required Fiji package from their Galaxy instance, they are guaranteed to get the exact same version of the required Fiji package when they re-install the tool.

Using the latest stable build URL will not guarantee this behavior.

&gt; Downloads page is pretty clear about that.
&gt; 
&gt; The main problem with the Fiji continuous releases is that they are not
&gt; currently archived anywhere and you can't downgrade. So to actually roll
&gt; back you'd need to know which commit hash you were on and rebuild Fiji using
&gt; Maven. Someday we hope to have a rollback feature, but it's probably not
&gt; going to happen this year.
&gt; 
&gt; As for when we do another Life-Line version: we try to do one just before
&gt; making disruptive changes. The next disruptive change will certainly be the
&gt; switch over to Java 8 with a new deployment scheme that retires the ImageJ
&gt; Launcher. We hope to roll that out before September.</span >

This is really good to know - it helps clarify some of my upcoming development plans.

I have tried using the latest stable release of Fiji for these plugins that I've found that do not produce output images that I expect, and it has made no difference.

I've also looked into using xvfb to see if it will work for what I'm doing, but I've discovered it really won't.  So I guess I just won't be able to wrap some of the plugins into Galaxy tools.  This is unfortunate, but understandable.  There are still very many useful ImageJ tools that I can wrap.

I have not yet figured out an easy way to determine if a plugin command will run successfully from the command line without getting pretty far down the &quot;finished wrapper&quot; path so that it can be tested.  If you have any ideas about this, I would greatly appreciate them.

I appreciate all of your help on this ticket - you can close it when convenient.   Please let me know if there is something else I should do regarding its status.

Thanks again!
